# Welcome to the Carpentry Setup repository. 

This repository is meant to store information on how to create Carpentry GitHub repositories for Carpentry workshop. 
With this information you should be able to : 
- create a new carpentry repository
- update its content to match your workshop (location, date and so on)
- generate automatically the workshop web pages

This version of the documentation is targeted to make the best out of the workshop repositories we already created in the past. 
You can always rely on the official carpentry documentation.

Official documentation can be found here : 
- https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template
- https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-workshop-websites.html

However, the official documentation covers a number of use cases that, at TU Delft, we are unlikely to encounter. 
(For instance, we do not really host our own website, and "building" the website locally was -so far- only done for bug fixing). 

For more information about the infrastructure, the whole setup relies on GitHub Pages.
You can consult the official documentation for more information on this mechanism. 

-----------------------------

## Step 1: Copy an existing repository 

All workshop websites are very similar in content, therefore the easiest way of setting up a new repository is to start from an existing one and then modify the copy. 

### Pick your reference repository

The official documentation suggest copying the following repository to get started : https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template
This repository is both the template of the website, as well as the documentation of the template and how to adjust it. 

If you want to minimize the customization effort afterwards, you can pick a workshop website from the "4TU.Center for research data" organization. You should pick a repository containing a workshop which content is close (or identical) to what you intend to do during your workshop. 

Example: the Software Carpentry workshop organized on the 25th of Sept. 2019 covers the Git, Shell and Python lesson. The repository and its website were created by copying the repository of the Software Carpentry organized in Delft in July. The July repository was picked because it covers exactly the same lessons as the one organized in September.


### Do the copy

Once you have chosen the most suitable repository, import it. Don't fork it.
NOTE: you can't rename forked repositories, and we have a strong naming convention for workshop names.

To import a repository, find the "Import" button, located on the top right of the github page, inside the drop down menu "+".
Click on the "+", and select "import repository". 

In the Import page, set the name of the source at the top (full URL of the repository is fine). 
In the bottom field (the destination) select the user that will manage the repository - pick the "4TU.ResearchData-Carpentries" organization (so that the repository gets created along side of the others). 

Set the name of the copy. Follow the carpentry naming convention: DD-MM-YYYY-location

Click on "Import" at the bottom of the page and wait ! This may take a while (5 to 10 minutes). You may get a confirmation email once the operation is completed. 

## Quick test 

At this point, you should already be able to access the workshop website. It is generated by GitHub, and your source (template or previous repository) should be working. You can try to access to site right away. 

If the URL of your repository is : http://www.github.com/USER_NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME 
Then the associated GitHub Page sould be http://USER_NAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME

## Step 2: Adjust the content of the site

Now that we have a working site, we need to change its content (you either have a template, or a website for an outdated workshop right now). 

There are few files that *must* be updated. 

### index.md

This file contains the main practical information about the workshop: location, date, program, link to ticket/registration, instructors,... 
There are instruction inside the file on what can and should be changed. 

All you really need to change is located at the top of the file. 

TIP: it is easy to make a mistake (forget a comma, or a quote). When you are editing the page, if you want to test it, try the Preview mode. If the table is not presented neatly (you see text rather than a table), there is something wrong in your page!

Note: for the EventBrite ID, the expected identifier is the numbers at the end of the URL of the dedicated eventbrite event page for the carpentry. If you URL is eventbrite.com/MY-Event-Some-Description-XXXXXXXX , the XXXXXXX are the ID you want.

### _config.yml

In this file, all you need to update is (located at the top of the page) the workshop type and the workshop title. 

Note: The workshop type must match what you've put in the index.md file. Otherwise you will get an error message on the web page. 

### _include/navbar.html

In this file, you will find the HTML code that describes the content of the top banner of the website. 
You may want to add or changes the images that are displayed there (usually logos of participating institutions). 

To remove an icon, remove the complete HTML block. For instance, this is a complete block for an icon (TU Delft logo here).

    <a href="https:://www.tudelft.nl">
      <img src="https://www.xibis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tudelft1-300x117.png" alt="xibis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/10 /tudelft1-300x117.png" height="50px;" style="margin: 0px 10px" />
    </a>
    
The block starts with "<a href...", and ends with "</a>". 

To add an icon, copy paste the code above, change the link you want associated with the icon by changing the value after "href", and change is icon by replacing the "src=" value with the URL to the image you want to be displayed. 

## Step 3: Check everything! 

You can now access your website and check if the content matches your expectation!
