# Welcome to the Carpentry Setup repository. 

This repository is meant to store information on how to create Carpentry GitHub repositories for Carpentry workshop. 
With this information you should be able to : 
- create a new carpentry repository
- update its content to match your workshop (location, date and so on)
- generate automatically the workshop web pages

This version of the documentation is targeted to make the best out of the workshop repositories we already created in the past. 
You can always rely on the official carpentry documentation.

Official documentation can be found here :

- https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/a-new-template-for-workshop-websites.html
